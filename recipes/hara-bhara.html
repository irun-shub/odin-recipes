    <h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Hara Bhara Kabab is a very popular snack of North Indian fried patties made with spinach, peas and potatoes.
        This word means a kabab full of greens.

        Here the green colored veggies are spinach and green peas. These are nutritious since they have the best of both
        spinach and green peas.
    </p>
    <p>
        True to its name Hara bhara kabab boosts of green health. Made from spinach, peas, potatoes, it is satisfying,
        healthy, delicious and tastes great with any chutney dip or sauce.

        I have seen these patties listed in the starter section of the menu in many North Indian restaurants. A couple
        of times we have it outside and they were okay

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>
        Set a stock pot on high heat, add ample amount of water in it & bring it to a boil, add the spinach to the
        boiling water along with green peas & salt, blanch them for 10-15 seconds then remove them using a spider &
        transfer into a bowl full of ice-cold water, strain them & squeeze out as much water as possible & transfer them
        into a chopper, now using the chopper grind the vegetables finely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set a pan on high flame & let it heat well, then add ghee, cumin seeds, ginger, garlic, green chillies, stir &
        cook on medium flame until the ginger & garlic starts browning a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further add the french beans, carrot & cauliflower, stir & cook on high flame for 4-5 minutes then add the
        spinach & peas paste to the pan, stir & add salt to taste, stir well again & cook until all the moisture is
        evaporated then transfer the cooked vegetables into a bowl & let them cool down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once cooled down grate the boiled potato along with the paneer, then add salt, black salt & all the powdered
        spices, fresh coriander, mint & mix the mixture well using your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now to bind the mixture well add the bread crumbs in batches & the corn flour, mix well using your hands again,
        once the desired consistency is achieved taste for salt & adjust it accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        To shape the kebabs, coat your hands with a little bit of oil & take a spoonful of mixture in your hand, form a
        roundel of the mixture then apply pressure using your other hand & press it to form a tikki, then place a split
        cashew on the tikki & press it gently, your tikki is ready, shape the remaining mixture in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set a handi on high flame & heat the oil for frying, the oil should be medium hot, carefully drop the tikkis in
        the hot oil, do not stir the kebabs for 1 minute so that a covering is formed that will hold the kebab in its
        shape, stir them around later & fry them on medium flame for 2-3 minutes, remove them from the oil using a
        spider & transfer them into a sieve for the excess oil to drip off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your hara bhara kebas are ready. Serve it hot with the dahi wali hari chutney.
