    <h4> Steps for dough:</h4>
    <p>
        In a mixing bowl, add warm water, warm milk, curd, sugar and ghee, mix well until the sugar dissolves.
        Further, use a sieve and sift the dry ingredients, together, add them in the water milk mixture and combine

        knead it well for at least 12-15 minutes while stretching it
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially you will feel the dough is very sticky, but do not worry as and when you'll knead it will smoothen and
        form like a proper dough.
        Keep kneading until it's smooth, soft & stretchy. Shape in a big size dough ball by tucking inwards and to make
        a smooth surface. Apply some ghee over the dough surface and cover it with a cling wrap or a lid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rest the dough in a warm place for at least an hour, after the rest, knead the dough once again and divide in
        equal size dough balls. Apply some oil over the dough balls surface and rest them for at least ½ an hour, make
        sure to keep them covered with a damp cloth.
        By the time they are resting you can make other components.

        <li>Cumin 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Coriander seeds 1.5 tbsp</li>
        <li>Boiled potatoes 4-5 medium sized</li>
        <li>Ginger 1 inch (chopped)</li>
        <li>Green chillies 2-3 nos. (chopped)</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander 2 tbsp (chopped)</li>
        <li>Fresh mint 2 tbsp (chopped)</li>
        <li>Black salt ½ tsp</li>
        <li>Carom seeds 1 tsp</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>
        Set a pan on low flame, add jeera & coriander seeds, and dry roast them on low flame until they are fragrant,
        transfer them in a mortar pestle and cool down a little bit, further crush them coarsely and keep aside to be
        used in making the kulcha filling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prefer to grate the boiled potatoes instead of mashing them, as when you'll roll the kulchas the small potato
        chunks in the filling may come out.
        For making the filling, add grated potatoes & all the remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl, along with the
        crushed cumin & coriander seeds, mix well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add onions to the mixture, but make sure to add them just before making the kulchas or else the raw onions may
        leave a smell in the entire filling. Mix & combine well, the kulcha filling is ready to be used.
